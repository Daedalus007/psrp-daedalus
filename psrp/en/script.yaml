    Alisa, my sister.<line><line>
    Listen closely, I don’t have long.<wait more>
    The rumors we've heard are true. LaShiec has... changed.<line>

    All of the horrible creatures outside, all of the darkness in our lives...<line><line>
    Somehow, it all traces back to him.<wait more>
    I tried to learn how, but I guess I got too close to the truth.<line><line>
    There's only one option left now, for all of us.<wait more>
    Lord LaShiec must be stopped.<line><line>
    If he isn't, the darkness he's aligned himself with will claim all of Algol.<wait more>
    My mistake was trying to take him on alone.<line><line>
    These are dangerous people, you’re going to need help.<wait more>
    I’ve heard tales of a warrior, a man named Tylon, who could be an ally.<line><line>
    I tried to enlist his help, but he's gone missing.<wait more>
    You have to find him, Alisa.<line><line>
    Find Tylon, and defeat LaShiec. Together, you can bring peace back to Algol.<wait more>
    Alisa... such a terrible burden. I’m so sorry.<line><line>
    Please forgive me, for asking this of you...<wait more>
    ...and for leaving you all...<line><line>
    ...alone...<wait>
